# nhentai-dl
Download images from Nhentai using a simple, fast, non-bloated `fish` script.

# Usage  
Mark script as executable (ex: `chmod +x nhdl`)
To run, type `./nhdl [number]` and let it run all the way through.

# Dependencies
[Fish](https://fishshell.com/), grep, wget, and sed are needed. Fish is probably all you need to obtain as most distros already include the latter three.
