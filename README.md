# nhentai-dl
Download images from nHentai using a simple, fast, non-bloated `POSIX sh` script.

# Dependencies
POSIX sh, curl, and generic coreutils. POSIX sh is probably all you need to obtain as most distros already include the latter three.

# Usage  
Mark script as executable (ex: `chmod +x nhdl`)
To run, type `./nhdl -d [number]` and let it run all the way through

# To-do
- Allow for multiple arguments (codes) for simultaneous downloads on text-only systems
- Allow for random download of user-specified tag or complete random download
